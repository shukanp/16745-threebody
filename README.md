# Optimal Control Final Project

## Completed so far

1. Read Chapter 1 of Dynamical Systems, the Three-Body Problem (Koon) book
2. Created (this) GitHub
3. Gathered references

## Next things (To-Do)

* Skim references
* Calculate Lagrange Points
* Generate motion of a particle (spacecraft) in 2D
   * Dynamics: f(x) --> vector of the states (4 states, 2 pos and 2 vel)
   * Integration: rk4()
   * Plot
   * 3D Visualizer

## Figure out (questions)

* What to do with dynamics?
   * Add inputs?
   * If adding inputs, implement feedback controller?
       * LQR?
       * MPC?
       * iLQR?
       * SQP?
