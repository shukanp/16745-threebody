# Optimal Control Final Project
  
## The following code is capable of:

1.Calculate Non-Linear 3rd Order Expansion of the CR3BP 

2.Sets up the NLP using IPOPT with DIRCOL using Hermite-Simpson Integration 

3.Leverage the Sparsity Pattern of the Constraint Vector Jacobian 

4.After solving the NLP it can generate different families of a specific halo orbit scaling it in each iteration 

5.Create a TV-LQR to maintain a disturbed third body into the calculted Halo-Orbit
