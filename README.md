# Optimal Control Final Project
  
## The following code is capable of:

1. Calculating Non-Linear 3rd Order Expansion of the CR3BP 

2. Setting up the NLP using IPOPT with DIRCOL using Hermite-Simpson Integration 

3. Leveraging the Sparsity Pattern of the Constraint Vector Jacobian 

4. Solving the NLP and generating different families of a specific halo orbit scaling it in each iteration 

5. Creating a TV-LQR controller to maintain a disturbed third body into the calculted Halo-Orbit
